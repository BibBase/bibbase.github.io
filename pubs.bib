  abstract="We explore the Barreirinhas Eddies, submesoscale vortices generated by the North Brazil Current (NBC) off the Barreirinhas Bight (Brazil, centered at 1.75°S), using vessel-mounted and moored ADCP data, and a Global HYCOM reanalysis. These double-stacked anticyclones with incredibly high Rossby Number [O(10)] occur independently at different depths (high Burger number). Anticyclones with Rossby number greater than unity are unstable according to inviscid linear theory, and hence these submesoscale features are not easily observable at mid latitudes. At these low latitudes, they last about a week, allowing characterization by oceanographic surveys. Our analyses suggest this increased stability is due to the joint effect of strong winds, stratification, proximity to the equator, and topography. Heretofore hypothesized via analytical studies and seen in numerical models, our study confirms this stabilization process in observations, and is also a starting point for the description of the submesoscale dynamics in the NBC domain.",

  abstract="South of the Vitória-Trindade Ridge, a seamount chain off East Brazil, the Brazil Current (BC) meanders cyclonically within Tubarão Bight, occasionally forming the Vitória Eddy. It was recently found that the Intermediate Western Boundary Current (IWBC), which flows equatorward below the BC, cyclonically recirculate within Tubarão Bight. We present an analysis of AVISO observations that suggest that the Vitória Eddy formation is conditioned by the strength of the BC upstream of Tubarão Bight. A weak BC is prone to local meandering and eddy formation in the bight, while a strong BC suppresses eddy formation in the bight but triggers downstream meander growth. To study the effects of the IWBC recirculation on the BC meandering and the Vitória Eddy formation, we formulate a simple two-layer quasi-geostrophic model. In the model, the BC is represented by a meridional jet in the upper layer and the IWBC recirculation is a steady eddy in the lower layer. The lower-layer eddy effectively acts as a topographic bump, affecting the upper-layer jet via the stretching term \(\psi _{2}/{R_{d}^{2}}\), where ψ2 is the lower-layer streamfunction and Rd is the baroclinic deformation radius. Based on the AVISO sea-surface height data and previous observational studies, we define a stationary eddy and reference jet. We conduct a number of initial-value problem experiments varying the upper-layer jet speed. A weak upper-layer jet slowly meanders and develops a cyclone above the lower-layer eddy. As we increase the jet velocity, the meandering is faster and the cyclone is larger. But a too-strong jet has an opposite effect: the potential vorticity anomalies induced by the lower-layer eddy are quickly swept away, leading to explosive downstream meander growth; no cyclone is formed above the lower-layer eddy. In all cases, the initial meandering trigger is a linear process (the steering of the upper-layer jet by the lower-layer eddy). But even when the upper-layer jet is weak, nonlinearity quickly becomes important, dominating the dynamics after 10 days of simulation. The downstream meander growth is fully nonlinear. Our idealized QG model confirms that the IWBC recirculation can trigger the Vitória Eddy formation and elucidates the mechanisms involved in this process.",

  abstract="In the Bay of Bengal, the warm, dry boreal spring concludes with the onset of the summer monsoon and accompanying southwesterly winds, heavy rains, and variable air-sea fluxes. Here, we summarize the 2018 monsoon onset using observations collected through the multinational Monsoon Intraseasonal Oscillations in the Bay of Bengal (MISO-BoB) program between the US, India, and Sri Lanka. MISO-BoB aims to improve understanding of monsoon intraseasonal variability, and the 2018 field effort captured the coupled air-sea response during a transition from active-to-break conditions in the central BoB. The active phase of the ~20-day research cruise was characterized by warm sea surface temperature (SST > 30°C), cold atmospheric outflows with intermittent heavy rainfall, and increasing winds (from 2 to 15 m s−1). Accumulated rainfall exceeded 200 mm with 90\% of precipitation occurring during the first week. The following break period was both dry and clear, with persistent 10−12 m s−1 wind and evaporation of 0.2 mm h−1. The evolving environmental state included a deepening ocean mixed layer (from ~20 to 50 m), cooling SST (by ~ 1°C), and warming/drying of the lower to mid-troposphere. Local atmospheric development was consistent with phasing of the large-scale intraseasonal oscillation. The upper ocean stores significant heat in the BoB, enough to maintain SST above 29°C despite cooling by surface fluxes and ocean mixing. Comparison with reanalysis indicates biases in air-sea fluxes, which may be related to overly cool prescribed SST. Resolution of such biases offers a path toward improved forecasting of transition periods in the monsoon.",

  abstract="The southern branch of the South Equatorial Current (SSEC) is the northern limit of the South Atlantic Subtropical Gyre. When this current reaches Brazil around 14°S it bifurcates into a southward flow as the Brazil Current (BC) and the surface portion of the northward flowing North Brazil Undercurrent (NBUC). The SSEC system is a key component of the western boundary supply, influencing the NBUC/BC variability and, therefore, global climate through the Meridional Overturning Circulation. In this study, using altimetry satellite data and reanalyzes outputs (1993–2018), we revisit the SSEC mean state and show this current arriving at the South Atlantic western boundary as a multi-banded flow with surface signatures resulting from different subsurface cores. These bands have velocities between 0.02 and 0.07 m s$^{−1}$ and, as shown by ADCP data from the PIRATA project, their signature in synoptic scenarios is obscured by eddies and waves with velocities between 0.1 and 0.3 m s$^{−1}$. In addition, the SSEC annual cycle analysis shows that the seasonality of the bands is out of phase with each other, presenting westward transport anomalies between 0.4 and 2.6 Sv. Finally, our results show that the seasonality of this multi-banded flow both defines where the BC is born, and modulates the seasonality of semi-permanent mesoscale eddies off Brazil.",

  abstract = "At age 101, Walter Munk passed away in 2019. His groundbreaking discoveries will still guide and amaze oceanography students for years to come. Here, we perceive patterns in rotating tank with Munk's circulation theory aided by a Lagrangian particles tracking algorithm and numerical modeling. From information captured by video, we track the trajectories of drifters, and then objectively mapped the streamfunction to obtain the mean circulation pattern. We were able to reproduce the wind-forced anticyclonic and asymmetric gyre, including the western boundary intensification and its retroflection. The latter phenomenon was predicted by the non-linear version of Munk's model and observed in real subtropical gyres as small recirculation regions. We have configured two numerical model simulations mimicking the physical experiment, with linear and non-linear terms. The comparison between the numerical and physical experiments confirmed the effect of non-linear distortion of the gyre. Geophysical fluid dynamics is often hard to visualize, and counter-intuitive in a rotating system. We present this set of experiments as a tool for oceanography teaching. Besides studying general ocean circulation theories and observations through practical examples, this experiment provides an opportunity to develop basic image processing and geophysical modelling skills.",
